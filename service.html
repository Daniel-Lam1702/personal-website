            Service and community involvement have always been important aspects of my personal and professional development. Throughout my academic journey at <a href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/">Bellevue College</a> and Texas A&M University, I have sought opportunities to give back to my community by leveraging my skills in technology and leadership. One of the most impactful ways I have contributed is through my involvement in the Latinx Students of Bellevue College, where I served as Treasurer. In this role, I was responsible for managing the organization&rsquo;s finances, and I was deeply involved in organizing events and initiatives that aimed to empower Latinx students on campus. These events provided a platform for underrepresented students to connect, share their experiences, and gain access to resources that support their academic and personal growth.

          <p>
            In addition to my work with the Latinx community, I have been actively participating in hackathons where I used my technical skills to create solutions that address real-world problems. For instance, my team and I developed a web application during HowdyHack 2023 that streamlined the job and internship search process for students. While this project was technically challenging, it was also rewarding because it had the potential to make a tangible difference in the lives of my peers. This experience inspired me to continue looking for opportunities where I could use my technical expertise to benefit others.

            In the future, I am eager to continue giving back to my community by mentoring younger students interested in technology. I understand the challenges of pursuing a career in computer science, especially for those from underrepresented backgrounds. I want to provide guidance and support to help them navigate their academic and professional journeys. Additionally, I am interested in volunteering to teach coding and digital literacy skills to underepresented populations. I believe technology can transform lives, and I am committed to using my skills to help bridge the digital divide and create opportunities for others. Through direct mentorship, community outreach, or developing technology-driven solutions to social issues, I am dedicated to giving back and making a positive impact on those around me.
